        <h2>About Us</h2>
		<p id="bigger">Rising Agro is a group of young intellectual professionals who aims to rejuvenate the conventional way of agriculture with prime focus over the production of <i><b>nutritious and pesticide free fruits and vegetables</b></i>. Conventional agriculture yielding toxic food is not only based over the irrational use of pesticides, herbicides & fertilizers but it has also degraded the fertility of soil and results in huge wastage of water compared to the net to the yield obtained. Quality of obtained food is further degraded because processing steps such as polishing, coloring & waxing used to show it a fresh.
Rising Agro team grows pesticide-free exotic fruits and vegetables by the use of state of art scientific technique of <b>Hydroponics</b>. It ensures production of nutritious food, which not only nourishes our body but also fully satisfies soul.
Rising Agro keeps a long term vision to ensure the availability of pesticide free nutritious food in abundance using eco-friendly technique of Hydroponics.
Hydroponic farming technique uses water as a media for supplying necessary nutrients, which a particular plant absorbs from soil for its growth. Hydroponic technique not only ensures pesticide free production but also conserve valuable source of life i.e., water by recycling it. The technique is also area efficient as it ensures more production of quality food due to cultivation of crops in vertical dimension. Net yield per area of hydroponics is significantly higher than that of traditional methods. Hydroponic technique ensures efficient use of water by circulating it again and again using closed loop mechanism. Apart from absorption of water by plants the only water loss is due to natural mechanism of evaporation, which is too low due to water usages in green house chamber within closed structures.
Rising Agro ensures highest level of bio-protection of the grown food. By proper monitoring of each crop within green house, we ensure production of healthy, disease free and nutritious food. No pesticides and insecticides are used.</p>
	
	<p id="bigger">Rising Agro team grows fruits and vegetables in the city arena itself and thus ensures quick delivery of matured food to the market on daily basis with the spirit that it should reach to the end customer as quickly as possible. By doing this, we try to ensure nutritional protection and natural taste of food and avoid unnecessary food processing steps, which compromise its quality.</p>
